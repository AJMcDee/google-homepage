This repository is my attempt to repicate the look of the google.com main page as part of my progress through the tutorials in The Odin Project.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

I am hoping to demonstrate the ability to use basic HTML and CSS functions to assist in positioning elements on a page.
